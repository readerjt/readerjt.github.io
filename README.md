<h1> Jason Reader Digital Game Studies Minor Application</h1>
<hr>
<p> <b> Who you are? </b> </p>
<p>----> I am Jason Reader, a Junior and current Computer Science student here at Miami University. I enjoy playing video games,
 hanging out with my friends and family, and reading, in my free time.</p>
<p> <b> Why you want to study Interactive Media Studies? </b> </p>
<p>----> I want to study Interactive Media Studies because I have always had an overwhelming interest in video games and 
what can truly make a video game special. I am extremely interested in the aspect of game development, but would also love to
learn more about how games are made and the different creative aspects that can go into a story of a game. Along with those topics,
I am looking to gain more perspective on the various impacts video games can have on other people.</p>
<p> <b> What interests you most about Digital and Emerging Technology? </b> </p>
<p>----> I believe what interests me most about Digital and Emerging Technology is how rapidly it can, and is, impacting the world we live in. Technology
is the future of not only the job industry, but the world itself. There are so many levels to technology and the ability it has to change our lives every day. To me,
video games is just one specific industry of technology that can truly have a great impact in our world. Video games have impacted me my whole life, and I 
dream of being able to create something from scratch that can give somebody an experience they may not be able to experience in real life.</p>
